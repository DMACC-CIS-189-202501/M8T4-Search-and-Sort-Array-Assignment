TODO: Update the above to your repo name

## Instructions for students

- Implement your solutions in `assignment.py`
- The tests in `test_assignment.py` can be inspected but do not modify them

### Directions - Copy/Pasted from Canvas

* Write 2 functions sort_array() and search_array().
* search_array()
  * Returns the index of the object in the array or a -1 if the item is not found.
* sort_array()
  * This will sort the array
  * can this just sort it?
  * or does it need to return the object?
